This repository contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the single-cell RNA-seq analyses published in Somite-independent regeneration of the axolotl primary body axis (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.31.577464)

Following scripts contain the commands for STARsolo used for mapping raw reads and describe the basic prefiltering and cell type annotation/isolation:

1. TailBud_SS2.Rmd
2. Tail_Project_1wpa.Rmd
3. Tail_col_2wpa.Rmd
4. Tail_col_0wpa_All.Rmd
5. Tail_twist_0wpa.Rmd


This script was used to combine and analyze cells across the different timepoints and samples and to perform quadratic programming:

6. Tail_Integration_col_0_1_2wpa.Rmd
